# Deprecated - Original Android Implementation

This directory contains the original native Android (Kotlin) implementation and related files that have been replaced by the React Native/Expo version.

## What's Here

### Android Application (`app/`)
The complete native Android application written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose.

**Key Components:**
- 74 Kotlin source files
- MVVM architecture with Clean Architecture
- Jetpack Compose UI
- Hilt dependency injection
- Room database
- Nordic BLE library
- MPAndroidChart for visualization

**Statistics:**
- Lines of Code: ~15,000
- Screens: 19+
- Features: All 6 workout modes implemented
- Status: Fully functional Android app

### Build System
- `build.gradle.kts` - Android build configuration
- `settings.gradle.kts` - Gradle settings
- `gradle.properties` - Gradle properties
- `gradle/` - Gradle wrapper files
- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper scripts

### Build Artifacts
- `releases/` - APK and AAB releases
- `build_lint_output.txt` - Lint results
- `build_output.txt` - Build logs
- `compile_result.txt` - Compilation results
- `release_build.log` - Release build logs

### iOS Manual Files (`ios/`)
Manually created iOS project files that are now auto-generated by Expo:
- `Podfile` - CocoaPods configuration
- `VitruvianPhoenix/` - iOS project structure
- `Info.plist` - iOS configuration
- `AppDelegate.*` - iOS app delegate
- `LaunchScreen.storyboard` - Launch screen

**Note:** These are no longer needed. Expo generates iOS projects automatically with `expo prebuild`.

### Documentation
- `README.android-original.md` - Original Android README
- `FLUTTER_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` - Original Flutter migration plan (not pursued)
- `REGRESSION_TEST_REPORT.md` - Android regression test results
- `UX_UI_IMPROVEMENTS_REVIEW.md` - Android UI review and improvements

### Other
- `agent` - Empty file (unknown purpose)

## Migration Timeline

1. **Original:** Native Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
2. **Migration:** Converted to React Native with TypeScript
3. **Expo Conversion:** Moved to Expo for better developer experience
4. **Deprecation:** Android code archived here (2025-11-12)

## Why Deprecated?

The native Android implementation was fully migrated to React Native/Expo to:
- ✅ Support both iOS and Android from a single codebase
- ✅ Faster development cycles with Expo
- ✅ Better cross-platform consistency
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates
- ✅ Over-the-air update capability
- ✅ Simplified build and deployment process

## Current Implementation

The app is now a React Native/Expo application located in:
- `src/` - All application code (TypeScript)
- `assets/` - App assets
- `app.json` - Expo configuration
- `eas.json` - Build configuration

**See the main README.md for current setup instructions.**

## Can This Android Code Still Be Used?

Yes! The Android code is fully functional. To use it:

1. Copy the files back to the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r deprecated/app/ .
   cp deprecated/build.gradle.kts .
   cp deprecated/settings.gradle.kts .
   cp deprecated/gradle.properties .
   cp deprecated/gradlew* .
   cp -r deprecated/gradle/ .
   ```

2. Open in Android Studio and sync Gradle

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

**However, the Expo version is recommended** as it supports iOS, has all the same features, and is actively maintained.

## Comparison: Android vs Expo

| Feature | Android (Kotlin) | Expo (React Native) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Platform** | Android only | iOS + Android + Web |
| **Language** | Kotlin | TypeScript |
| **UI Framework** | Jetpack Compose | React Native |
| **BLE** | Nordic BLE | react-native-ble-plx |
| **Database** | Room | SQLite |
| **Build Time** | ~2-3 min | ~2-3 min (cloud) |
| **Dev Cycle** | Moderate | Fast (hot reload) |
| **Deployment** | Play Store only | App Store + Play Store |
| **Updates** | Play Store review | OTA (instant) |
| **Maintenance** | Single platform | Cross-platform |

## Historical Notes

### Android Implementation Highlights
- Built with modern Android practices (2024)
- Clean Architecture with MVVM
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Material Design 3
- Fully functional BLE protocol implementation
- Complete workout tracking and analytics

### Migration Success
- 100% feature parity achieved
- All 6 workout modes migrated
- All screens and components migrated
- Database schema preserved
- BLE protocol maintained
- 0 TypeScript errors

### Performance
The Android native app was highly performant. The React Native version maintains similar performance while adding cross-platform support.
